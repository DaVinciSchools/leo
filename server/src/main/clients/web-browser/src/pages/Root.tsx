            <p>
              Project Leo is an AI-powered classroom platform designed for
              students and teachers engaged in project-based learning,
              portfolio, or similar curricula. Our platform draws inspiration
              from the ikigai philosophy to engage students in their educational
              journey. Project Leo also allows teachers to incorporate
              differentiation more easily into their classes, thus helping
              students find their own unique paths to success.

              <p>
                Project Leo utilizes the ikigai philosophy to engage students in
                their educational journey. By leveraging this approach with a
                schoolâ€™s specific standards, we transform assignments into a
                meaningful exploration of students' personal and professional
                goals. Our approach is not just about completing tasks; it's
                about supporting students as they uncover and cultivate
                individual passions and interests. Learn more about our use of
                the ikigai approach here.

                Project Leo actively assists students in designing, researching,
                and creating projects across all classroom subjects. A key
                advantage of Project Leo in project-based learning is its
                ability to nurture students' passion by focusing on subjects and
                topics that intrigue them personally. Project Leo's structured
                guidance leads students through project phases, ensuring
                consistent progress without always needing direct teacher
                intervention. Students enjoy the independence Project Leo
                fosters, coupled with personalized, timely feedback from
                teachers, all within a user-friendly platform.

                is to foster a love of lifelong learning by providing a platform
                for students to explore their passions, build new skills, and
                prepare for future careers.

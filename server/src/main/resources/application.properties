# Properties in this file are available to Spring. However, there are some
# libraries that are not aware of the Spring framework. Consequently, they
# do not pick up on the properties in this file. If you add a property
# that doesn't seem to take effect in an external library, see if it needs
# to be added to CopyEnvironmentPropertiesToSystemProperties

# These properties can be overridden for production or testing. See this
# documentation for how to do so:
# https://github.com/DaVinciSchools/leo/blob/main/BUILDING.md#external-dependencies

# Since we are proxying requests to the React server during development, we
# need to pass header values to the client that we normally wouldn't set.
# So, we have to whitelist restricted header names so that WebClient allows
# them.
#
# This is only used during development. So, it's okay that this approach is
# brittle.

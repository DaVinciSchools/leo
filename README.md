===========

**Project Leo** is a classroom system developed by
[Da Vinci Schools](https://www.davincischools.org/) that amplifies Career-Relevant Learning.

Its goal is to identify, connect, and harness a student's
*[Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai)*[^1] to prepare a student for a career that they
love.

Project Leo not only helps a student identified their *Ikigai*, but aids a student by connecting
students to:

* **Professionals** to pass along knowledge through tiered volunteer opportunities.
* **Teachers** to build meaningful learning experiences around high demand competencies.
* **School Leaders** to monitor and improve student career preparedness.

In turn, students **develop a portfolio** of *Ikigai*-based career-relevant projects that build
their skills and demonstrate their mastery of their subject.

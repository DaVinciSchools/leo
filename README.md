# Project Leo

Project Leo presents a way to identify, connect, and harness the Ikigai[^1] of students so that they
can build career relevant portfolios in every classroom. A student's Ikigai is the intersection of:

* What a student loves to do
* What a student is good at
* What the world needs
* What you can get paid for

Go to www.projectleo.com to learn more about it and how you can get involved.
